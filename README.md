Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - Mall Customer Segmentation

Steps Performed
Checked for missing values and duplicates (none found)

Renamed columns to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores (as follows):

customer_id

gender

age

annual_income_k

spending_score

Confirmed all data types were correct
